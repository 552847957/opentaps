/**
 * A page builder allows post-processing of the results generated by a ListBuilder.
 * These are useful when a generic list builder such as EntityListBuilder is sufficient
 * to retrieve the data but the overhead of defining a custom ListBuilder to process the
 * results is not desired.
 *
 * The canonical usage is to create an anonymous instance of this interface containing
 * an implementation of build().  For example,
 *
 * PageBuilder pageBuilder = new PageBuilder() {
 *      List build(List page) throws Exception {
 *          return page;
 *      }
 * }
 *
 * Then you would give this page builder to a list builder,
 *
 * listBuilder.setPageBuilder(pageBuilder);
 *
 * When this interface is combined with special list builders such as BshListBuilder, we
 * end up with a powerful way to define the construction of lists of data from within a script.
 *
